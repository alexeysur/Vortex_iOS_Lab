Make a functions that takes a string and makes it look “cool” by replacing some letters with another symbols

Letters to replace: a - @; i - 1; s - $; o - 0; t - +
(replace both capital and lowercase letters)

example:

func makeItCool(_ string: String) -> String { … }

makeItCool(“today”) -> “+0d@y”

makeItCool(“Swift is awesame”) -> “$wif+ 1$ @we$@me”
